### Musics using PowerShell Script

Here you can find PS Scripts that makes music.

## Avalible songs
- Harry Potter üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Seven Nations Army by The White Stripes

## How it's made ?

I'm just using this :

```ps
powershell "[console]::beep(<tone>,<duration>)"
```

Higher the tone value is, more acute the sounds get.
